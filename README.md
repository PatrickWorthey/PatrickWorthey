Welcome. This GitHub is my professional portfolio and development environment. A space dedicated to practical cybersecurity tooling, analysis workflows, and continuous technical growth.

My focus areas include building automation for digital forensics and incident response (DFIR), writing custom detection and hunting queries, and exploring how modern AI can be responsibly leveraged to improve efficiency and effectiveness in day-to-day security operations.

My goal here is to maintain tools, scripts, and guides with clarity, reusability, and professional impact in mind. Everything is either used in my current work or represents a learning project that has contributed to my growth as a security professional.

## Focus Areas

### Python for Security Analysts
Purpose-built Python scripts designed to solve real problems in the DFIR and blue team space. This includes tools for metadata extraction, log analysis, regex-based filtering, and modular automation techniques. Each project is structured, well-documented, and adaptable for use across different environments. I particularly enjoy building internal tools that keep sensitive data in-house and reduce external dependencies.

### KQL for Threat Hunting
A growing repository of threat hunting queries tailored for Microsoft Sentinel and Defender environments. Queries are organized and optimized for clarity, adaptability, and investigative depth. The goal is to create detection logic that supports real analysis, not just alerts.

### AI for Analyst Workflows
This area explores how local LLMs and automation frameworks can support security teams without compromising privacy or reliability. Projects include examples of summarization, correlation, enrichment, and analyst assistance.

### Beginner Cyber Hub
While my professional focus is on advanced capability building, I maintain one dedicated space to support those who are just starting out. This repository includes annotated scripts, foundational concepts, and practical advice based on my own entry into the field. It reflects a core belief: growth should be shared.

### Working Projects and Study Builds
This section documents active learning projects used to deepen my technical knowledge. Some are based on challenge sets, textbooks, or reconstructed examples from trusted sources. Others are personal implementations developed during study or certification prep. The aim is to demonstrate how I approach problems, structure my learning, and translate that into code.

## Professional Intent

This GitHub exists to serve three purposes:

1. Build and maintain tools that are immediately useful and easily customizable.
2. Demonstrate my capability, clarity of thought, and technical progression over time.
3. Contribute meaningfully to the broader security community through shared, usable work.

If you're working in similar areas or have feedback to share, I'm always open to learning, exchanging ideas, and collaborating on meaningful projects.
